## CSSunit

We can test CSS! I'm not going to test how the a page look but test than a DOM element or group of element have the required style.

Imagine you finish the style of the home page or link. You can export them style and constantly check if you don't overwrite them with an other CSS rule. 

If we know than an element need to be at 30px from the border of the windows... we can also test that!
