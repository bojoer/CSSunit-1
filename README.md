# CSSunit

We are not going to test how the a page look but only if DOM element or group of element have the required style. But what mean "required"?

Imagine, you finish the style of links or an home page. By exporting this element's styles and constantly check than no other CSS rule overwrite them, you keep this work safe.

Now, if you know than an element need to be at 30px from the border of the windows... we can also test that!
